# Remote-File-Downloader-to-cPanel
This project provides a simple PHP-based solution to download remote files directly to the server hosting the script (e.g., on cPanel). The script includes a graphical progress bar and percentage tracking to enhance the user experience. It supports downloading files to a specific folder on the server while displaying the progress in real-time.
